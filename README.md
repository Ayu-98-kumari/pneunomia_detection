# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays

Binary classification of chest X-ray images into **NORMAL** and **PNEUMONIA** using PyTorch CNNs and transfer learning.

## Dataset

Uses the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset. Place the extracted data so the directory looks like:

```
Pneumonia_project/
├── chest_xray/
│   └── chest_xray/
│       ├── train/
│       │   ├── NORMAL/
│       │   └── PNEUMONIA/
│       └── test/
│           ├── NORMAL/
│           └── PNEUMONIA/
└── pneumonia_detection/
    └── (this project)
```

## Setup

```bash
cd pneumonia_detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Experiments

There are 5 experiments, each defined by a config file:

| # | Config | Architecture | Weighted Sampling | Augmentation | Epochs | LR |
|---|--------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|----|
| 1 | `configs/baseline.yaml` | 3-layer CNN | No | No | 8 | 0.001 |
| 2 | `configs/weighted_sampling.yaml` | 3-layer CNN | Yes | No | 8 | 0.001 |
| 3 | `configs/augmentation.yaml` | 3-layer CNN | Yes | Yes | 15 | 0.001 |
| 4 | `configs/deeper_cnn.yaml` | 5-layer CNN + Dropout | Yes | Yes | 8 | 0.001 |
| 5 | `configs/resnet18.yaml` | Pretrained ResNet-18 | Yes | Yes | 5 | 0.0001 |

## Training

Train a single experiment:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/baseline.yaml
```

Train all experiments one by one:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/baseline.yaml
python train.py --config configs/weighted_sampling.yaml
python train.py --config configs/augmentation.yaml
python train.py --config configs/deeper_cnn.yaml
python train.py --config configs/resnet18.yaml
```

Trained models are saved to the `checkpoints/` directory.

## Evaluation

Evaluate a trained model on the test set:

```bash
python evaluate.py --config configs/baseline.yaml
```

Evaluate all experiments:

```bash
python evaluate.py --config configs/baseline.yaml
python evaluate.py --config configs/weighted_sampling.yaml
python evaluate.py --config configs/augmentation.yaml
python evaluate.py --config configs/deeper_cnn.yaml
python evaluate.py --config configs/resnet18.yaml
```

To evaluate with a specific checkpoint file:

```bash
python evaluate.py --config configs/resnet18.yaml --checkpoint path/to/model.pth
```

Evaluation prints confusion matrix, classification report, and threshold analysis for each config's defined thresholds.

## Knowledge Distillation

The distilled student (DeeperCNN, ~1M params) learns from the frozen ResNet-18 teacher (~11M params) using BCE-style soft + hard label loss.

The distilled student (DeeperCNN, ~1M params) learns from the frozen ResNet-18 teacher (~11M params) using a combined loss:

```
Loss = alpha * BCE(student_logit, sigmoid(teacher_logit))   ← soft label loss
     + (1 - alpha) * BCE(student_logit, hard_label)         ← ground truth loss
```

The teacher is frozen throughout — only the student's weights are updated. Both teacher and student receive the same augmented image but through different transforms (3-channel ImageNet-normalized for the teacher, 1-channel grayscale for the student). A weighted sampler handles class imbalance during training. Best student checkpoint is saved based on validation accuracy.

### Scripts

| Script | Config | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `distill_best.py` | `configs/distillation_best.yaml` | Train final best model (alpha=0.5) from scratch |
| `distill_sweep.py` | `configs/distillation_sweep.yaml` | Compare alpha=0.7, 0.5, 0.3 — useful for showing experimentation |
| `evaluate_distilled.py` | `configs/distillation_best.yaml` | Evaluate already-trained distilled model, no retraining needed |

### Training

**Train the best known configuration (alpha=0.5, threshold=0.85):**

```bash
python distill_best.py --config configs/distillation_best.yaml
```

Trains from scratch, saves best model by validation accuracy, evaluates across all thresholds, and saves a final checkpoint with embedded metadata (alpha, threshold, class names).

**Run the alpha comparison sweep (0.7, 0.5, 0.3):**

```bash
python distill_sweep.py --config configs/distillation_sweep.yaml
```

Trains three separate student models from scratch (one per alpha), evaluates each across all thresholds, and prints a summary table at the end. Use this to compare alphas and justify the choice of alpha=0.5.

### Evaluation (no retraining)

If the distilled model is already trained (checkpoint exists in `checkpoints/`), evaluate it directly without retraining:

```bash
python evaluate_distilled.py --config configs/distillation_best.yaml
```

This script handles both plain state dict checkpoints and metadata-rich checkpoints (saved by `distill_best.py` or from notebook experiments). It will print the alpha, threshold, and class info embedded in the checkpoint before running evaluation.

To evaluate with a specific checkpoint:

```bash
python evaluate_distilled.py --config configs/distillation_best.yaml --checkpoint path/to/model.pth
```

### Results (best config — alpha=0.5, threshold=0.85)

| Model | Params | Accuracy | Macro F1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standalone DeeperCNN | ~1M | 87% | 0.86 |
| **Distilled DeeperCNN** | **~1M** | **88%** | **0.87** |
| Teacher ResNet-18 | ~11M | 92% | 0.91 |

The distilled student matches the teacher's architecture footprint (~1M params) while closing the gap from 87% → 88% accuracy by learning from the teacher's soft predictions.

## Adding a New Experiment

1. Create a new YAML file in `configs/` (copy an existing one as a starting point).
2. Adjust the parameters (model, lr, epochs, augmentation, etc.).
3. Run `python train.py --config configs/your_new_config.yaml`.

No code changes needed unless you're adding a new model architecture (in that case, add it to `src/models.py` and register it in `get_model()`).
